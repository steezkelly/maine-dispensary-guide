# AGENTS.md — Maine Dispensary Guide

## Project Overview

Astro 6.0 static site deployed to Vercel. High-authority cannabis business resources for Maine — 157 guide pages (109 city + 48 technical), 35 blog posts, 224 dist HTML pages. Technical compliance maps, B2B lead-gen tools.

**SCOPE: Maine Only** — Do NOT propose or build state-specific hubs for other states.

**This is a real, monetizable web property** — not a demo. Decisions about content, structure, and SEO have compounding consequences.

**Host:** https://mainedispensaryguide.com

**Components:** `Breadcrumbs`, `Callout`, `Faq`, `GuideSidebar`, `Leaf`, `NextStep`, `PineTree`, `RelatedArticles`, `Search`

---

## Do

- Read `BOT_COLLABORATION_HUB.md` before starting any task
- Audit `src/pages/` and `src/components/` before proposing new pages or features
- Use design tokens / CSS variables — never hardcode colors
- Use semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`)
- Use geometric icons (◆ ▲ ✦) for callouts, not emoji
- Use slash-less internal links (`/about` NOT `/about/`)
- Use `path.basename()` for path splitting — `f.split('/').pop()` fails on Windows
- Run file-scoped typecheck after changes
- Write to `BOT_COLLABORATION_HUB.md` after completing significant work
- Use Formspree (`https://formspree.io/f/xvgzlowz`) for all lead capture forms
- Pass `article` prop to Layout on guide pages for JSON-LD schema
- Close Playwright browser after EVERY operation — memory leak otherwise

## Don't

- Do not deploy without verifying checks are green and scope is understood
- Do not propose generic best-practice solutions without auditing what exists
- Do not use trailing slashes in internal links
- Do not use pure white (#FFF) on dark backgrounds — use Warm Bone `#F2F2E2`
- **`npm run build` — run freely, no "ask first" needed.** Routine verify
  step. Same for `vercel-build.sh`, `npx astro check`, and any file-scoped
  or full-project typecheck. Log non-trivial build outcomes in the Hub
  when relevant; do not gatekeep the command.
- **`astro.config.mjs`, `vercel.json`, `turbo.json`, deployment scripts —
  edit freely when the change is reversible and well-tested** (header
  rules, post-build steps, build flag toggles). The audit+typecheck
  pass is the substitute for "ask first." For genuinely breaking or
  one-way-door changes (deleting a redirect, removing a CSP source,
  changing the output adapter), still flag in the Hub with intent
  before committing.
- **Content pages — edit freely when the change is small, mechanical,
  and reversible** (typo fixes, missing semantic tags like `<h1>`,
  mixed-content protocol bumps, dead-link fixes, JSON-LD corrections).
  Log non-trivial content edits in the Hub. For wholesale rewrites
  (>20% of the page) or any change that affects a published editorial
  position, still flag in the Hub before committing.
- Do not recommend building something that already exists
- Do not leave Playwright browser open — each instance = 100-750 MB memory leak

> **Reframed 2026-06-06.** The previous "ask first / without flagging"
> rules created 3-4 extra permission ping-pongs per audit/fix turn and
> did not catch any real defects that the audit+typecheck loop didn't
> already catch. New rule: **trust the verify loop, log in the Hub,
> flag only on one-way-door / wholesale / irreversible changes.**

---

## Safety & Permissions

**Allowed without prompt:**
- Read files, list directories
- Run file-scoped typecheck, format
- Search codebase (glob, grep)

**Ask first:**
- `npm install` new packages
- Deleting files, chmod changes
- One-way-door config changes (see `## Don't` above for the criteria)

---

## Pre-Flight Validation

Before starting any session that will: (a) run more than 20 tool calls,
(b) touch more than 10 files, (c) use browser automation, or (d) call
external APIs, you MUST run pre-flight. Invoke `/preflight <category>`
or execute the equivalent checks manually.

**Categories and checks:**

- `environment` — `node --version`, `npm --version`, `npx astro check`
  exit 0, target directory writable, git working tree status captured.
- `browser-automation` — confirm no leftover Playwright processes
  (`ps aux | grep -i playwright` returns nothing unexpected), target
  URLs reachable via HEAD request, disk space > 2 GB free.
- `file-write` — destination directory exists, not read-only, not
  inside `node_modules/` or `dist/`, git branch is not `main`.
- `external-tool` — tool binary present (`which <tool>`), `--version`
  succeeds, credentials resolved (env vars set, no literal placeholders).

**On failure:** stop, report the failed check, do NOT begin the main
task. Fix the environment first.

**On success:** capture the pre-flight report in the session as a
single assistant message so it's discoverable in later insights runs.

Rationale: 357 tool errors across 14 days, most from predictable
environment issues. Pre-flight catches these in <30 seconds instead
of 50 messages deep.

---

## Playwright Discipline (hard rule)

For every `playwright_browser_navigate` or equivalent browser spawn,
there MUST be a matching `playwright_browser_close` before the session
ends, OR before spawning the next navigation if the first is no longer
needed. No exceptions.

Enforcement: if the session uses browser automation, the final
assistant message before completion must include a "Browser cleanup"
line explicitly confirming all instances were closed. If unsure,
close defensively — re-opening is cheap; the 100–750 MB-per-instance
leak is not.

If a browser is needed across multiple sub-tasks, document the intent
in the first navigation and close in the last sub-task.

## LSP Status (lsp_diagnostics)

**Status: NOT WORKING** — `lsp_diagnostics` returns "The `typescript.tsdk` init option is required" for all file types in this project.

### The Error
```
Error: Request initialize failed with message: The `typescript.tsdk` init option is required.
```

### Root Cause
OpenCode Desktop's LSP client fails to initialize the TypeScript language server with Astro 6.0. The error occurs even when:
- `typescript` is installed in `node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js` ✅
- `@astrojs/language-server@2.16.6` is installed ✅
- `astro-ls --version` returns `2.16.6` ✅
- `OPENCODE_RESPECT_LSP_DIAGNOSTICS=10` is set ✅
- Explicit `lsp` config with `tsdk` path added to `opencode.json` ✅

This is a **confirmed incompatibility** between OpenCode Desktop's LSP implementation and Astro 6.0 projects.

### Workaround (Use This)
```bash
npx astro check src/pages/example.astro   # Type check single file
npx astro check                           # Type check all files
```
This uses `tsc` directly and works reliably. It is not affected by LSP issues.

### This does NOT affect build/deploy** — the site builds and deploys cleanly with 123 known non-blocking type errors.

---

## Type Checking — Astro Projects

**Default:** Do NOT use `lsp_diagnostics` for `.astro` files. The
`typescript.tsdk` resolution error documented previously is persistent
and will waste 5+ minutes per occurrence.

**Use instead:**
- `npx astro check` for project-wide diagnostics.
- `npx tsc --noEmit -p <tsconfig>` for pure TS files outside `.astro`.
- Run both after any non-trivial edit to `src/pages`, `src/layouts`,
  or `src/components`.

Only fall back to `lsp_diagnostics` for non-Astro TypeScript files
where the LSP is known-good.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Astro 6.0 with `mdx` and `sitemap` integrations
- **Adapter:** Vercel (Static Mode, `output: 'static'`)
- **Design System:** "Heritage Authority" — High-contrast (12.8:1), Fraunces/Jakarta typography
- **Lead Gen:** Formspree (`xvgzlowz`)
- **Analytics:** GA4 (`G-614GHG67ZQ`) + Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights
- **Search:** Brave Search (primary), Wikipedia (secondary), Playwright MCP (browser)

---

## Conventions

### TypeScript & Components
- Strict mode (`astro/tsconfigs/strict`)
- Props interfaces in frontmatter
- Components: PascalCase (`DispensaryCard.astro`)
- Pages: lowercase (`guides/portland-dispensary-guide.astro`)
- CSS Variables: kebab-case (`--color-primary`)

### Layout Article Prop (GEO/SEO)
```astro
const article = {
  author: "Maine Dispensary Guide Editorial Team",
  publishDate: "2026-01-15",
  modifiedDate: "2026-03-28",
  section: "City Guides"
};
---
<Layout title="..." article={article}>
```

### CSS & Dark Mode
```css
:root { --color-background: #F2F2E2; }       /* Warm Bone */
[data-theme="dark"] { --color-background: #061A1B; } /* Deep Spruce */
```
- Use variables, never hardcode colors
- `aria-label` on interactive elements, `.sr-only` for screen readers
- Animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Astro Patterns
```astro
<script is:inline>
  // Runs immediately, not bundled (theme/theatre logic)
</script>
```

### Lead Capture Forms
```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/xvgzlowz" method="POST">
```

### Related Articles (Smart Matching)
Guide pages show related articles via topic intersection. Define topics in frontmatter:
```astro
const topics = ["city", "market"];
---
<Layout title="..." topics={topics}>
```
Available topics: city, market, licensing, finance, real-estate, operations, compliance, marketing, business

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

- `BOT_COLLABORATION_HUB.md` is the **source of truth** — read before starting, write after completing
- Format: `[AGENT] [DATE] [EDT TIME] — note`

### Agent System — 6-Agent Pantheon

| Agent | Role | Best For |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Orchestrator** | Master delegator | Complex multi-step tasks |
| **Oracle** | Strategic advisor | Architecture decisions, persistent bugs, YAGNI |
| **Librarian** | External docs | Library research, official examples |
| **Explorer** | Codebase search | Fast grep/glob, "where is X?" |
| **Designer** | UI/UX specialist | Styling, responsive layouts, polish |
| **Fixer** | Fast implementation | Bounded tasks, test writing |
| **Observer** | Visual analysis | Screenshots, images, PDFs, visual regression |

### When to Use @observer
Invoke the Observer agent (via `task` with `subagent_type="observer"`) for:
- **Screenshot comparison:** After UI changes, verify before/after match design intent
- **Image generation review:** After fal.ai image generation, verify image quality before committing
- **Visual regression testing:** After design system changes, check all pages for regressions
- **PDF content extraction:** Extract text from PDFs without loading raw file into context
- **Screenshot QA:** Capture and analyze browser output for UI bugs

**Example invocation:**
```
task(description="Review homepage redesign", prompt="Compare screenshot of / after recent CSS changes against design intent. Report any visual regressions or issues.", subagent_type="observer")
```

**Note:** Observer is configured but was not being invoked. Use it proactively for visual QA tasks — it prevents bugs that code review misses.

**Rule of thumb:** When in doubt, delegate. Specialists are faster and better.

---

## Process & Safety

### Sprint Retrospective (Every Multi-Step Sprint)
After completing any sprint with 3+ steps or 4+ agents:
1. **What worked** — note effective patterns for reuse
2. **What failed** — bugs, wrong delegation sizes, missing deps
3. **Is it a pattern?** — if yes, promote to `memory.md` or update `corrections.md`
4. **Process change?** — if yes, update AGENTS.md or `memory.md`

**Rule: "Complete" means tested.** Declare done only after running integration commands, not just syntax checks.

### Loop Guards
- Any loop >100 iterations MUST log progress
- If spinning without output for 30+ seconds, abort and report

### Playwright
- Uses Chrome (`mcp-chrome-5134796`), NOT Edge
- MUST call `browser_close` after EVERY operation

### Error Handling
- Avoid server-side logic that crashes edge functions
- Use versioning (e.g., v1.0.4) in footer for cache-clearing verification

## PR Checklist

- [ ] Typecheck passes (or errors are known/pre-existing)
- [ ] Diff is small and focused — summarize what changed and why
- [ ] No excessive logs or comments left in code
- [ ] `BOT_COLLABORATION_HUB.md` updated with decision log

---

## When Stuck

- Ask a clarifying question, propose a short plan, or flag in the Hub
- Do not push speculative changes without confirmation (audited+typechecked changes with documented intent are fine — see `## Don't`)
- For OpenCode issues: see `reference/opencode-config.md` for diagnostics
